# microshift-ci:create-bugs

## Synopsis

```bash
/microshift-ci:create-bugs <source> [--create]
/microshift-ci:create-bugs <source1>,<source2>,... [--create]
```

## Description

Reads individual job analysis reports produced by `microshift-ci:doctor` and creates JIRA bugs in USHIFT for CI test failures. Operates in **dry-run mode by default** - it shows what bugs would be created without actually creating them. Use `--create` to perform actual issue creation.

Candidates are always **fuzzy-matched across sources** using token-based overlap similarity (50% threshold) with step-name bucketing — the same root cause appearing in multiple releases becomes a single candidate and a single Jira bug referencing all affected releases.

This command does NOT re-analyze CI jobs. It consumes existing job analysis files from `<WORKDIR>`.

## Arguments

- `<ARGUMENTS>` (required): Source identifier(s), optionally followed by flags
  - `<sources>` (required): One or more comma-separated sources. Each source is one of:
    - **Release version** (e.g., `4.22`, `main`): Looks for files matching `jobs/release-<release>-job-*.txt`
    - **PR number** (e.g., `pr-6396` or `pr6396`): Looks for files matching `jobs/prs-job-*-pr<number>-*.txt`
    - **Rebase PR shorthand** (e.g., `rebase-release-4.22`): Resolves to the corresponding rebase PR by scanning existing `jobs/prs-job-*` files for the matching release version in their content
  - `--create` (optional): Actually create/update JIRA issues. Without this flag, only a dry-run report is produced. See Step 3 for the auto-decision policy.

## Prerequisites

- Job analysis files must already exist in `<WORKDIR>/jobs/`:
  - For releases: `jobs/release-<release>-job-*.txt` (produced by `/microshift-ci:doctor`)
  - For PRs: `jobs/prs-job-*-pr<number>-*.txt` (produced by `/microshift-ci:doctor`)
- Each job file must contain a `--- STRUCTURED SUMMARY ---` block (see below)
- MCP Jira server must be configured and accessible
- User must have permissions to create issues in USHIFT

### STRUCTURED SUMMARY Block

Each job analysis file produced by `/microshift-ci:prow-job` must end with a machine-readable JSON block. The block is a JSON array with one object per independent failure. Each file may contain multiple entries when a job has independent failures across different scenarios.

```text
--- STRUCTURED SUMMARY ---
[
  {
    "severity": 3,
    "stack_layer": "test",
    "step_name": "openshift-microshift-e2e-metal-tests",
    "error_signature": "concise, unique description of the root cause error",
    "root_cause": "one-line description of WHY the failure happened",
    "raw_error": "verbatim primary error message from logs",
    "infrastructure_failure": false,
    "job_url": "full prow job URL",
    "job_name": "full periodic job name",
    "release": "4.22",
    "remediation": "suggested fix or next step",
    "finished": "2026-06-01"
  }
]
--- END STRUCTURED SUMMARY ---
```

If a job file lacks this block, it is skipped with a warning.

## Work Directory

Compute once at the start by running `date +%y%m%d` and substituting into the path below. In all commands, replace `<WORKDIR>` with the computed path — do not use shell variables.

```text
/tmp/microshift-ci-claude-workdir.<YYMMDD>
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Bug Candidates (Deterministic Script)

**Actions**:

1. Parse `<ARGUMENTS>` to extract source(s) and detect the `--create` flag
2. Split sources on commas to get `SOURCES` list (e.g., `["4.22"]` or `["4.20", "4.21", "4.22", "5.0", "main"]`)
3. Compute `SOURCE_TAG` — a short identifier used in per-run output filenames (merged candidates, results, report). Use the **first source** in the list (e.g., `4.22`, `main`, `rebase-release-4.22`). Do NOT concatenate all sources.
4. Determine mode: if `--create` is present, set `MODE=create`; otherwise `MODE=dry-run`
5. Determine today's WORKDIR path by running `date +%y%m%d` and substituting into `/tmp/microshift-ci-claude-workdir.<YYMMDD>`. Run `mkdir -p` on it. Run `mkdir -p <WORKDIR>/bugs`.
6. For **each source** in `SOURCES`, run the preparation script:

   ```text
   python3 plugins/microshift-ci/scripts/search-bugs.py <source> --workdir <WORKDIR>
   ```

   Each invocation writes `<WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-candidates-<source>.json` containing parsed and deduplicated bug candidates with pre-computed `keywords`, `test_ids`, `jobs[]`, and `remediation`.

**Error Handling**:

- No arguments: show usage and stop
- Script exits with error if no job files found — relay its error message to the user

### Step 1a: Check for Cached Jira Results

After loading per-source candidates (Step 1), check whether bug mapping files already exist for ALL sources. These files are written by Step 2 on every run and contain the Jira search results (`duplicates[]`, `regressions[]`). If they exist and cover all per-source candidates, Step 2 can be skipped entirely.

**Actions**:

1. For each source in `SOURCES`, check if `<WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-matches-<source>.json` exists
2. If **ALL** files exist:
   a. Read each file and build a lookup map: `error_signature` → `{duplicates, regressions}` (aggregate across all source files)
   b. For each per-source candidate across all sources, look up its `error_signature` in the map
   c. If **ALL** candidates have a match: display a notice and **skip Step 2**, proceed directly to Step 2a:

      ```text
      Using cached Jira search results from prior run.
      To force fresh Jira searches, delete the bug mapping files:
        rm <WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-matches-*.json
      ```

   d. If **ANY** candidate has no match in the cache: discard all cached data and proceed to Step 2 (full Jira search for all candidates — do not mix cached and fresh results)
3. If **ANY** source file is missing: proceed to Step 2 (full Jira search)

### Step 2: Search Jira for Existing Bugs and Write Bug Mapping Files

For each **per-source** bug candidate (iterate over each source's candidate list separately — do NOT merge first), run **ALL THREE** searches (A, B, C) described below. Do NOT skip any search — the HTML report depends on complete `duplicates` and `regressions` arrays. The `keywords` and `test_ids` fields are pre-computed by the script — use them directly.

**Search A — Keyword search (multiple focused queries)**:

1. Use the pre-computed `keywords` array from the candidate (already filtered for stop words and ranked by specificity)
2. Run **2-3 separate searches in parallel**, each using 1-2 keywords from the array. Do NOT put all keywords into a single `text ~` query — Jira requires all terms to match, so queries with 3+ keywords are fragile and miss issues that use slightly different wording.

   ```python
   # Example: candidate.keywords = ["invalidclienttokenid", "cloudformation", "createstack", "aws-2"]
   # Search A1: most distinctive keyword
   mcp__jira__jira_search(jql='... AND issuetype = Bug AND text ~ "invalidclienttokenid" ...', limit=5)
   # Search A2: second keyword
   mcp__jira__jira_search(jql='... AND issuetype = Bug AND text ~ "cloudformation" ...', limit=5)
   ```

3. Merge and deduplicate results from all A-series queries before proceeding

**Search B — Test case ID search (MANDATORY when `test_ids` is non-empty)**:
Use the pre-computed `test_ids` array from the candidate. For EACH ID, run TWO separate searches:

```text
# Search B1: bare number
jql: ... AND issuetype = Bug AND text ~ "68256" AND status not in (Closed, Verified) ...

# Search B2: OCP-prefixed form (OpenShift Polarion convention)
jql: ... AND issuetype = Bug AND text ~ "OCP-68256" AND status not in (Closed, Verified) ...
```

**Why both forms are required**: Jira's text indexer treats `OCP-68256` as a single token, so `text ~ "68256"` will NOT match issues containing `OCP-68256`, and vice versa. Skipping either form WILL cause missed duplicates.

**After searches A and B**:

1. Merge and deduplicate results from all search queries (A, B1, B2)

**Search C — Regression check (MANDATORY for every candidate)**:

This search is **required** for every candidate, even when Search A/B already found open duplicates. It populates the `regressions` array in the mapping file, which the HTML report renders separately from open bugs.

Run a keyword search against closed/verified issues:

```python
mcp__jira__jira_search(
  jql='((project = OCPBUGS AND component = MicroShift) OR project = USHIFT) AND issuetype = Bug AND text ~ "<keywords>" AND status in (Closed, Verified) ORDER BY updated DESC',
  limit=5
)
```

Record **every** result as a regression entry — these are shown in the HTML report with distinct "Regressions" styling.

**Note**: Run searches in parallel where possible. All three searches (A, B, C) can run concurrently per candidate.

**Recording results — duplicates and regressions**:

After completing ALL searches for a candidate:

1. **`duplicates` array**: Must contain ALL unique open bugs returned by searches A and B (deduplicated by key). Do NOT stop at the first match — record every issue returned.
2. **`regressions` array**: Must contain ALL unique closed/verified bugs returned by Search C (deduplicated by key). An empty `regressions` array means Search C returned zero results — not that it was skipped.
3. Do NOT filter either array for relevance — downstream scripts use overlap similarity to match bugs to failures.
4. Extract `key`, `summary`, `status`, `assignee` (display name), and `updated` (YYYY-MM-DD) directly from the search results — `jira_search` returns these fields by default. Do NOT call `jira_get_issue` for each entry.

**Query for open AI-generated bugs**: After completing all per-candidate searches, run one additional query to fetch all open bugs with the `microshift-ci-ai-generated` label:

```text
mcp__jira__jira_search(
  jql="project = USHIFT AND issuetype = Bug AND labels = microshift-ci-ai-generated AND status not in (Closed, Verified) ORDER BY updated DESC",
  fields="summary,status,priority,assignee,created,updated",
  limit=50
)
```

If more than 50 results, paginate with `start_at` until all issues are fetched. For each issue, extract: `key`, `summary`, status name, priority name, assignee display name, `created` and `updated` truncated to date only (first 10 characters).

**After completing all Jira searches**, write machine-readable bug mapping files per source. For each source in `SOURCES`, write `<WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-matches-<source>.json` using this JSON format:

```json
{
  "source": "<source>",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "candidates": [
    {
      "error_signature": "<error_signature>",
      "severity": <N>,
      "failure_type": "<build|test|infrastructure>",
      "step_name": "<step_name>",
      "affected_jobs": <count for this source>,
      "duplicates": [
        {"key": "<JIRA-KEY>", "summary": "<summary>", "status": "<status>", "assignee": "<display_name>", "updated": "<YYYY-MM-DD>"}
      ],
      "regressions": [
        {"key": "<JIRA-KEY>", "summary": "<summary>", "status": "<status>", "assignee": "<display_name>", "updated": "<YYYY-MM-DD>"}
      ]
    }
  ],
  "open_bugs": [
    {
      "key": "USHIFT-1234",
      "summary": "...",
      "status": "In Progress",
      "priority": "Normal",
      "assignee": "jdoe",
      "created": "2026-05-01",
      "updated": "2026-05-09"
    }
  ]
}
```

1. **IMPORTANT**: These files must be written in BOTH dry-run and create modes. They enable `create-report.py` to show linked bugs in the HTML report, and are consumed by the merge step (Step 2a) for Jira-based deduplication.
2. **IMPORTANT**: The `duplicates` and `regressions` arrays must contain ALL results from their respective searches — do NOT omit or filter (see "Recording results" above). Missing entries mean missing bug links in the HTML report.
3. Use empty arrays `[]` for `duplicates` and `regressions` only when the respective searches returned zero results.
4. The `failure_type` field must be set from the candidate's computed `failure_type` (via `classify_breakdown`). This field is required for downstream `--merge` to correctly skip infrastructure failures without needing `stack_layer`.

### Step 2a: Merge Candidates

Run the merge script (even for a single source — it produces a unified output with Jira data injected from the bug mapping files written in Step 2).

Before invoking, also check for any `bug-candidates-rebase-*.json` files in `<WORKDIR>/bugs`. If found, include them in the merge so rebase PR failures are deduplicated against release failures.

```text
python3 plugins/microshift-ci/scripts/search-bugs.py --merge <WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-candidates-<source1>.json [<source2>.json ...] [<WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-candidates-rebase-*.json] --output <WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-candidates-merged-<SOURCE_TAG>.json --workdir <WORKDIR>
```

This writes `<WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-candidates-merged-<SOURCE_TAG>.json`. Read and use this file for all subsequent steps.

### Step 3: Present Bug Candidates to User

**Actions**:

1. **In dry-run mode** (`--create` NOT specified):
   - Apply the Auto-Decision Policy (see below) to each candidate
   - Do NOT display individual candidates to the user — the report in Step 5 handles that
   - Do NOT create any issues. Do NOT proceed to Steps 4/4b
   - Build the results array (see Results JSON below), write it, and continue to Step 5

2. **In create mode** (`--create` specified):
   - Apply the auto-decision policy and execute actions
   - For candidates where decision is "create": proceed to Step 4
   - For candidates where decision is "update": proceed to Step 4b
   - For candidates where decision is "skip": record the skip reason and move to next
   - Continue to Step 5

#### Auto-Decision Policy

Apply these rules in order for each candidate:

| Condition | Decision | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| `failure_type` is `"infrastructure"` | **Skip** | `"Infrastructure failure — not a product bug"` |
| Has open duplicates from Jira search | **Update** | `"Will update <JIRA-KEY> with new CI occurrences"` — target is the first entry in the candidate's `duplicates` array. Proceed to Step 4b. |
| Has closed regressions but no open duplicates — and **all** job `finished` dates are **on or before** the regression's `updated` date | **Skip** | `"Stale failure predating fix for <JIRA-KEY> (updated <YYYY-MM-DD>)"` |
| Has closed regressions but no open duplicates — and **any** job `finished` date is **after** the regression's `updated` date | **Create** | Add `"Potential regression of <JIRA-KEY>"` to the bug description's Additional Info section |
| No duplicates, no regressions | **Create** | `"No existing duplicates"` |

#### Results JSON

As you process each candidate (applying auto-decision policy), build a results array. After all candidates are processed (and Steps 4/4b complete for create mode), write the results to `<WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-results-<SOURCE_TAG>.json`:

```json
{
  "mode": "dry-run",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "results": [
    {
      "error_signature": "<matches candidate's error_signature exactly>",
      "action": "create",
      "jira_key": "USHIFT-1234",
      "skip_category": "",
      "reason": "No existing duplicates"
    },
    {
      "error_signature": "<matches candidate's error_signature exactly>",
      "action": "update",
      "jira_key": "USHIFT-6938",
      "skip_category": "",
      "reason": "Will update USHIFT-6938 with new CI occurrences"
    },
    {
      "error_signature": "<matches candidate's error_signature exactly>",
      "action": "skip",
      "jira_key": "",
      "skip_category": "infrastructure",
      "reason": "Infrastructure failure — not a product bug"
    }
  ]
}
```

All fields are required on every entry:

- `error_signature`: must match the candidate's `error_signature` exactly
- `action`: one of `create`, `skip`, `update`, `failed`
- `jira_key`: the JIRA key for `create`/`update`; empty string `""` for `skip`/`failed`
- `skip_category`: one of `infrastructure`, `stale_regression`, `up_to_date` for `skip`; empty string `""` for other actions. `up_to_date` occurs when an `update` action is demoted to `skip` during comment deduplication in Step 4b
- `reason`: human-readable explanation, always non-empty

Set `mode` to `"dry-run"` or `"create"` matching the current run mode. Set `date` to today's date (YYYY-MM-DD).

### Step 4: Create Bug via MCP (create mode only)

**Actions**:
For each candidate where the auto-decision is "create":

1. **Construct the bug summary**:
   - Format: `"MicroShift CI: <error_signature>"` (truncate to 100 chars if needed)

2. **Construct the bug description** using **Markdown** format (the MCP Jira tool accepts Markdown and automatically converts it to Jira wiki markup — do NOT write Jira wiki markup directly):

   `````text
   ## Description of problem

   CI job failures detected across MicroShift releases: <release1>, <release2>, ...

   <concise description derived from the error signature, root cause, and remediation>

   ## Version-Release number of selected component (if applicable)

   <release1>, <release2>, ...

   ## How reproducible

   Always (fails consistently in CI across multiple releases)

   ## Steps to Reproduce

   1. Run the CI job(s) listed below
   2. Observe failure in step: <step_name>

   ## Actual results

   ````

   <error details from `raw_error`; use `remediation` for suggested next steps>

   ````

   ## Expected results

   CI job should pass successfully.

   ## Additional info

   **Stack Layer:** <stack_layer>
   **CI Step:** <step_name>
   **Error Severity:** <severity>/5
   **Analysis confidence:** <confidence>
   **Affected scenarios:** <comma-separated scenarios>
   **Number of affected jobs:** <total count across all releases>
   **Last observed:** <latest finished date across all jobs, YYYY-MM-DD>

   **Root cause chain:**
   <for each causal_chain link>
   1. <cause> (`<evidence>`: "<quote>")
   </for each>
   **Affected Releases:** <release1> (<N> jobs), <release2> (<N> jobs)

   **Affected Jobs:**
   <for each release>
   *<release>:*
   <for each job in release>
   - [<job_name>](<job_url>)
   </for each>
   </for each>

   **Source:** Auto-generated by /microshift-ci:create-bugs from CI analysis output.
   `````

   Omission rules for the new fields (candidates produced by older analyses lack them): omit the `**Analysis confidence:**` line when `confidence` is empty, the `**Affected scenarios:**` line when `scenarios` is empty, and the entire `**Root cause chain:**` block when `causal_chain` is empty.

3. **Create the issue**:

   ```python
   mcp__jira__jira_create_issue(
       project_key="USHIFT",
       summary="MicroShift CI: <error_signature>",
       issue_type="Bug",
       description="<constructed description>",
       components="MicroShift",
       additional_fields={
           "labels": ["microshift-ci-ai-generated"]
       }
   )
   ```

4. **Record the result**: Store the created issue key for the final report.

**Error Handling**:

- If MCP call fails, log the error, record the candidate as `"failed"` in the report, and continue to the next candidate. Do NOT prompt or retry.

### Step 4b: Update Existing Bug with Comment (create mode only)

**Precondition**: The candidate's action is `update` and the JIRA key has been validated (in Step 3).

**Actions**:
For each candidate where action is "update":

1. **Comment deduplication** — check whether the bug already has up-to-date CI data:

   a. Fetch the target bug's comments:

      ```python
      mcp__jira__jira_get_issue(issue_key="<JIRA-KEY>", fields="comment", comment_limit=50)
      ```

   b. Find the most recent comment containing the marker string `"CI Doctor: New occurrences detected"`.

   c. Extract the `**Last observed:**` date (YYYY-MM-DD) from that comment.

   d. If no CI Doctor comment exists, check the bug description as a fallback: if it contains `"CI job failures detected across MicroShift releases"` (i.e., it was created by CI Doctor), extract the `**Last observed:**` date from the description instead.

   e. Compare against the candidate's most recent job `finished` date:
      - If **all** job `finished` dates are **on or before** the last-observed date → the bug is already up-to-date. Change the action to `"skip"` with `skip_category="up_to_date"` and reason `"Already up-to-date on <JIRA-KEY> (last observed <YYYY-MM-DD>)"`. Move to the next candidate.
      - If **any** job `finished` date is **after** the last-observed date, or no last-observed date was found → proceed to post the comment.

2. **Construct the update comment**:

   ```text
   ## CI Doctor: New occurrences detected

   This failure continues to be observed in CI.

   **Error Signature:** <error_signature>
   **Error Severity:** <severity>/5
   **Number of affected jobs:** <count>
   **Last observed:** <latest finished date>

   **Affected Releases:**
   - <release1> (<N> jobs)
   - <release2> (<N> jobs)

   **Affected Jobs:**
   - [<job_name>](<job_url>)
   ...

   Updated automatically by /microshift-ci:create-bugs.
   ```

3. **Post the comment**:

   ```python
   mcp__jira__jira_add_comment(
       issue_key="<JIRA-KEY>",
       body="<update comment>"
   )
   ```

4. **Record the result**: Store the updated issue key for the final report.

**Error Handling**:

- If MCP call fails, log the error, record the candidate as `"failed"` in the report, and continue to the next candidate. Do NOT prompt or retry.

### Step 4c: Update Bug Mapping Files (create mode only)

**Precondition**: At least one candidate had action `create` in Step 4. (`update` actions only add a comment and do not require mapping file updates.)

After all bugs are created, update the per-source bug mapping files (`<WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-matches-<source>.json`) so that newly created bugs are reflected in the JIRA data consumed by the HTML report generator.

**Actions**:

1. **Collect new bugs**: Gather all candidates where action was `create`. For each, record the `jira_key`, `error_signature`, and the summary used in creation.

2. **Update each mapping file**: For every `<WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-matches-<source>.json` file (all sources, not just the current one):

   a. **Add to `open_bugs`**: Append each new bug to the `open_bugs` array (skip if the key already exists):

      ```json
      {
        "key": "USHIFT-XXXX",
        "summary": "MicroShift CI: <error_signature>",
        "status": "To Do",
        "priority": "Undefined",
        "assignee": "Unassigned",
        "created": "<today YYYY-MM-DD>",
        "updated": "<today YYYY-MM-DD>"
      }
      ```

   b. **Add to `duplicates`**: Find the candidate entry in the file's `candidates` array whose `error_signature` matches. If found, append the new bug to its `duplicates` array (skip if the key already exists):

      ```json
      {"key": "USHIFT-XXXX", "summary": "MicroShift CI: <error_signature>", "status": "To Do", "assignee": "Unassigned", "updated": "<today YYYY-MM-DD>"}
      ```

   c. **Write the updated file** back to disk.

3. **Skip if no bugs were created**: If all candidates were skipped or failed, do not modify mapping files.

### Step 5: Generate Results Report (Deterministic Script)

**Actions**:

1. Ensure `<WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-results-<SOURCE_TAG>.json` was written in Step 3
2. Generate the report:

   ```text
   python3 plugins/microshift-ci/scripts/search-bugs.py \
     --report <WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-results-<SOURCE_TAG>.json \
     --candidates <WORKDIR>/bugs/bug-candidates-merged-<SOURCE_TAG>.json \
     --workdir <WORKDIR>
   ```

3. Display the report output to the user

## Examples

### Example 1: Dry-Run for a Release (Default)

```bash
/microshift-ci:create-bugs 4.22
```

Shows what bugs would be created from release 4.22 analysis without creating anything.

### Example 2: Dry-Run for a PR

```bash
/microshift-ci:create-bugs pr-6396
```

Shows what bugs would be created from PR #6396 analysis.

### Example 3: Create Bugs for a Rebase PR

```bash
/microshift-ci:create-bugs rebase-release-4.22 --create
```

Resolves the rebase PR for release 4.22, then creates bugs.

### Example 4: Multi-Source Dry-Run

```bash
/microshift-ci:create-bugs main,4.22,4.21,4.20,5.0
```

Shows all failures across 5 releases with cross-release dedup applied. Failures appearing in multiple releases are merged into single candidates with `Releases:` lines.

### Example 5: Multi-Source Create

```bash
/microshift-ci:create-bugs main,4.22,4.21,4.20,5.0 --create
```

Creates bugs across all releases, updating existing Jira duplicates and skipping infrastructure failures. Cross-release duplicates are merged into single bugs referencing all affected releases.

### Example 6: No Job Files Found

```bash
/microshift-ci:create-bugs 4.19
```

```text
Error: No job analysis files found at <WORKDIR>/jobs/release-4.19-job-*.txt

Run the analysis first:
  /microshift-ci:doctor 4.19
```

## Notes

- This command does NOT run CI analysis — it only consumes existing analysis files from `<WORKDIR>`
- Supports two file naming patterns:
  - Release jobs: `jobs/release-<release>-job-*.txt` (from `/microshift-ci:doctor`)
  - PR jobs: `jobs/prs-job-*-pr<number>-*.txt` (from `/microshift-ci:doctor`)
- Dry-run is the default to prevent accidental bug creation
- The `--create` flag enables actual bug creation and updating
- Candidates are always merged via `search-bugs.py --merge` (even for a single source) to produce a unified output with Jira data injected. Cross-release deduplication uses fuzzy signature matching (token-based overlap similarity, 50% threshold)
- Infrastructure failures (`failure_type: "infrastructure"`) are automatically skipped — these are transient CI/cloud issues, not product bugs. Classification uses the same step-name-based logic as the HTML report (`classify_breakdown` in `classify.py`)
- Bugs are created in USHIFT with component "MicroShift"; duplicate search covers both USHIFT and OCPBUGS
- All created bugs are labeled with `microshift-ci-ai-generated` for tracking
- The STRUCTURED SUMMARY block in job files is required — this is a contract with `/microshift-ci:prow-job`
- Machine-readable bug mapping files (`bugs/bug-matches-<source>.json`) are written per source in Step 2 (both dry-run and create modes). They serve two purposes: (1) consumed by `create-report.py` to show JIRA bug links in the HTML report, and (2) consumed by `--merge` in Step 2a for Jira-based deduplication across releases
